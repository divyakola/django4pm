ex:
---
create a djnago project to print "hello world" on the webpage?

step1:
-----
to create a project
	django-admin startproject projectname

django-admin startproject proj2

step2:
-----
goto project location and to create an application in that project location.

	cd projectname

	python manage.py startapp appname

cd proj2

python manage.py startapp app2


step3:
------
to install our application in settings.py file of the project

	settings.py
	-------------
INSTALLED_APPS = [

    'app2'
]

step4:
-----
to create a view in views.py file of the application

	views.py
	--------
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def welcome(request):
    return HttpResponse("hello world")


step5:
-----
to configure the url pattern for our views in urls.py file

	urls.py
	------
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app2 import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('wel/',views.welcome)
]


step6:
-----
to apply the migrate for our applications(both builtin and userdefined)

	python manage.py migrate

step7:
-----
to start the server
	
	python manage.py runserver

step8:
------
to send request to the server

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/wel

project structure:
------------------
	proj2
	   |--->proj2
	   |      |---> settings.py
	   |      |---> urls.py
           |--->app2
	   |	  |---> views.py
	   |--->manage.py


View:
-----
a view is a python function or class,which is used to representing the business logics.

a view take the request from the end user,process that request and give back the response to the enduser.

	we can implement the views in views.py file of the application.

	every view should be registered with a url pattern in urls.py file.

types of views:
--------------
	views can be categorized into two types,they are

1).Function based views

2).class based views.

function based views:
--------------------
	we can create a view by using functions,that type of views are called function based views.

	whenever our requested url is matching of any one url pattern of urls.py file to return the request object,that request object is passing to default parameter of the view function and our view function will be executed.

	in function based views,we can perform different http methods like GET(),POST(),PUT(),DELETE(),..., by using conditional statements.
