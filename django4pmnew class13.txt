example:
-------
create a django project,to design the url patterns by using regular expressions?

step1:
-----
to create a project 
	
	django-admin startproject proj6

step2:
-----
goto that project location and create an application in that project

	cd proj6

	python manage.py startapp app6

step3:
------
to install our application in settings.py file of the project

	settings.py
	-----------
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    
    'app6'
]

step4:
------
to create a view in views.py file

	views.py
	--------
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def welcome(request):
    return HttpResponse("hello world")


step5:
-----
to configure the url patterns for our views in urls.py file

	urls.py
	-------
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from django.conf.urls import url
from app6 import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'wel',viws.welcome)
]

step6:
-----
to apply the migrate

	python manage.py migrate

step7:
-----
to start the server

	python manage.py runserver

step8:
------
to send the request to the server

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/wel

project structure:
-----------------
	proj6
	   |--->app6
	   |      |--->views.py
           |--->proj6
	   |      |--->settings.py
	   |      |--->urls.py
	   |--->manage.py


what is HTTP?
------------
	HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a web protocol,which is used to enable the communication between client and server.

	we can make/create the request object by using HttpRequest class

	we can get the response object by using HttpResponse class.

the HttpRequest methods are,

	GET(),POST(),PUT(),DELETE(),MOVE(),.........

the most commonly used HttpRequest methods are GET() and POST() in a web application.

differences between GET() and POST()?
------------------------------------

	GET()				POST()
------------------------------------------------------------
1).it is used to get the data	    1).it is used to post the data
from the server and we can post	       to the server(small,medium,
the small ammount of data to the       large amount of data).

2).we can made the get request in   2).we can made the post req in

uploading the files                    uploading the files

7).in GET(),the requested url	    7).in POST(),the requested url

                                       query string.


note:
------
whenever we are using GET(),one request object is created that is represented as dictionary object.

that dictionary object data will be loading into GET variable.

	if we want to get the values from GET request object hy using hashing.
	request.GET['key']


whenever we are using POST(),one request object is created that is represented as dictionary object.

that dictionary object data will be loading into POST variable.

	if we want to get the values from POST request object hy using hashing.
	request.POST['key']
