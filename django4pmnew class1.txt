what is web application?
------------------------
	a web application is a server-side program,that utilizes web browsers and web technolgies to perform a task over the web.

	now a days,we are implemented web applications based on 3-tier architecture.

	fig: 3-tier architecture


what are the requirements needed to develop an web applications?
-------------------------------------------------------------
	the following requirements are needed to develop an web applications,

	1).Technologies
	2).IDE's
	3).Design Pattern
	4).Runtime Environments

Technologies:
-------------
	the technologies can be categorized into 3-types,they are

	1).client-side technologies

	2).server-side technologies

	3).Database technologies

client-side technologies:
-------------------------
	these technologies are used to build the web pages and to perform the client side validations.

	the client side technologies are HTML,CSS,Javascript,bootstrap,
jquery,angularjs,...

	we can execute the client side technologies to required web browsers.

	ex:Chrome,firefox,IE,safari,opera,...

server-side technologies:
-------------------------
	these technologies are used to implement the business logics and to perform the server side validations.

	the server side technologies are python,java,.net(c#,asp.net,..),
ruby,php,....

	we can execute the server side programs to required servers(middleware servers),those server are

	apachetomcat,glasfish,WAS,IIS,DDS,Jboss,....

database technologies:
---------------------
	these technologies are used to perform the database related logics(to perform CURD operations).

	SQL is the most common database technology for  all databases.

	we can run the database programs,to required database servers.

	the database servers are Oracle,mysql,sql server,teradata,DB2,postgresql,..

note:
-----
we can open any webpage,in that web page we are observing 3-things

	1).structure		--> HTML

	2).style		--> CSS

	3).interactivity  	--> javascript

			HTML
		------------------
HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)

HTML is a Markup Language,which is used to build the webpages,it provides basic structure of the web pages.

HTML was developed by "Berners Lee" in the year of 1991 but officially released in to the public in the year of 1995.

HTML language is contains tag's

what is tag?
------------
	we can define any pre-defined word with in the angular brackets,is known as a tag.

	ex: < text >  -->text means any predefined word in HTML

types of tag's:

	tag's can be categorized into two types,they are

	1).container/pair tags
	
	any tag which contains both opening and closeing tags,that tags is called pair tags

		ex: <html>   -->opening tag
		      ...
                      ...
                    </html>  --> closeing tag

	2).empty/single tags
	
	any tag dont contains closeing tags,that tags are called single tags.

		ex: <br>,<hr>


note:
-----
the latest HTML version is HTML5

HTML is case insensitive language(<html> or <HTML>)

	if we want to write and execute the HTML programs to required editors(notepad,notepad++,editplus,..) and browsers(Chrome,Firefox,IE,safari,Opera,..)

	we can save the HTML file .html or .htm extensions

structure of the HTML:
----------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		-----
		-----
	</head>

	<body>
